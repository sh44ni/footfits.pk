                    <p>
                        You have <strong>3 days</strong> from the date of delivery to request a return. The delivery date is based on the courier tracking confirmation. Returns requested after 3 days will not be accepted.

                    <p className="text-yellow-900">
                        You <strong>must</strong> record a complete unboxing video when you receive your parcel. Start recording before opening the package and continue until you have fully inspected the shoe. This video is mandatory for all return and complaint requests. Without a clear, uncut unboxing video, we will not be able to process your return. This protects both you and us — it serves as proof of what was inside the package at the time of delivery.

                    <p>For a return to be accepted, all of the following must be true:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                        <li>The return is requested within 3 days of delivery.</li>
                        <li>You have a complete, uncut unboxing video showing the parcel being opened for the first time.</li>
                        <li>The shoe has not been worn outdoors — the sole must be clean with no dirt, scuffs, or wear marks.</li>
                        <li>The shoe is in the exact same condition as when you received it.</li>
                        <li>The original packaging is included.</li>
                        <li>You provide your order number and reason for return.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className="mt-4 text-sm bg-gray-50 p-3 rounded">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> We photograph every shoe from multiple angles before dispatch and will compare the returned shoe against our records. If the shoe shows any signs of wear that were not present at the time of shipping, the return will be rejected.
